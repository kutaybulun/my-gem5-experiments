give the sim the ability to tune the folowing parameters for O3 CPU:
issue width: 
    fetchWidth,         (NUMBER OF INSRUCTIONS TO FETCH PER CYCLE) (n)
    fetchBufferSize,    (FETCHED INTO THIS) (bytes) (n*4*cycles_of_slack)
    fetchQueueSize      (FETCHED INTO THIS) (n*cycles_in_fetchQ)
decode width: 
    decodeWidth         (NUMNBER OF INSTRUCTIONS TO DECODE PER CYCLE) (n)
register renaming: 
    numPhysIntRegs,     (PYHSICAL REGISTERS) (any, min:64?)
    numPhysFloatRegs,   (PHYSICAL REGISTERS) (any, min:64?)
    renameWidth         (NUMBER REGISTERS TO RENAME PER CYCLE) (n)             
send to instruction queue and load-store queue:
    dispatchWidth       (TOTAL NUMBER OF INSTRUCTIONS TO DISPATCH) (n)
    numIQEntries        (INSTRUCTION QUEUE DEPTH) (n*cycles_in_IQ)
    LQEntries           (LOAD DEPTH IN LOAD-STORE QUEUE) (n*cycles_in_LQ)
    SQEntries           (STORE DEPTH IN LOAD-STORE QUEUE) (n*cycles_in_SQ)            
issue, execute, writeback:
    issueWidth          (NUMBER OF INSTRUCTIONS TO ISSUE PER CYCLE) (n)
    wbWidth             (NUMBER OF INSTRUCTIONS TO WRITEBACK PER CYCLE) (n)
commit:
    commitWidth         (NUMNER OF INSTRUCTIONS TO COMMIT PER CYCLE) (n)
reorder buffer:
    numROBEntries       (REORDER BUFFER SIZE) (any, min:32?)

create your own workload
create all of the configs
start running
find a way to parse and visualize the results
run konata for select ones

in the report:
why SE mode?
what is the system, cache, memory etc.?
what is the architecture of the processors?
what do we tune and why?
